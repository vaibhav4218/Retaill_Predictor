# Retail Analysis and Prediction API

Welcome to the Retail Analysis and Prediction API. This project provides a RESTful API for analyzing retail data and predicting customer behaviors using machine learning models. The API includes functionality for predicting returning customers, repurchase likelihood, and recommending top products.

## Features
- **Customer Return Prediction:** Predict if a customer is likely to return based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- **Repurchase Prediction:** Predict if a customer will make repeat purchases based on their transaction history.
- **Product Recommendation:** Recommend the top products based on revenue generated from previous sales.

## Project Structure
```
├── app.py                      # Main Flask application
├── online_retail.csv           # Retail dataset (not included in the repository)
├── README.md                   # Project description and instructions
└── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retail-analysis-api.git
   cd retail-analysis-api
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Place the `online_retail.csv` file in the root directory of the project.**

## Usage
1. **Run the Flask application:**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the API:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Endpoints

### Customer Return Prediction
- **Endpoint:** `/customer_return`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Predict if a customer will return based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "accuracy": float,
    "classification_report": {
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

### Repurchase Prediction
- **Endpoint:** `/repurchase`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Predict if a customer will make repeat purchases.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "accuracy": float,
    "classification_report": {
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

### Product Recommendation
- **Endpoint:** `/recommend_products`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Recommend the top products based on revenue.
- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "StockCode": string,
      "Description": string,
      "TotalRevenue": float
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```

## Data Preparation
The dataset used for this project is `online_retail.csv`, which should contain retail transaction data. The data is cleaned and processed to handle missing values and generate features necessary for model training.

## Model Training
- **Customer Return Prediction:** A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of customers.
- **Repurchase Prediction:** A RandomForestClassifier is trained on features such as total quantity, number of transactions, average unit price, and recency days.
- **Product Recommendation:** The top products are recommended based on total revenue generated from sales.
